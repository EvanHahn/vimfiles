nkpart's vim files
==================

It's vim files, not much more to say.

Using it
--------

    $ git clone http://github.com/nkpart/vimfiles.git .vim
    $ cd .vim && ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc

Then fire up vim and run `:BundleInstall`.

I use it for with vanilla vim in a terminal, but everything should work in the guis as well.
